This project implements a **centralized blockchain** system using JavaScript. 
The blockchain is stored in memory as a central array and supports the following functions:
- `setBlock(data)` → Adds a new block to the blockchain.
- `getBlock(index)` → Retrieves a block by its index.
- `blocksExplorer()` → Displays all blocks in the blockchain.
- `mineBlock(index)` → Mines a block (proof-of-work simulation).
The blockchain starts with a Genesis Block and allows adding new blocks in a central system. 
This implementation is for educational purposes and demonstrates the basic principles of a blockchain.
